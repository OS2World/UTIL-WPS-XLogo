How to compile XLogo v1.0
July 1996
_________________________

I use the GCC compiler. I am hopeless with other compilers.
You should also have the Warp Developer's Toolkit installed.

First type

 rc -r XLogo.rc

then
 gcc -Zomf -Zsys -s -o Xlogo.exe Xlogo.c Xlogo.res Xlogo.def

 (or for simplicity,
  gcc -o XLogo.exe Xlogo.c Xlogo.res Xlogo.def )

Execute by running XLogo.exe.
Enjoy.
